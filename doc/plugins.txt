A plugin is a standalone piece of added functionality that can be added to a single channel in the bot, or the bot at large.

A plugin consists of:
 A .js file containing server-side functionality of the plugin
 A spec file containing markup of some kind to describe the plugin's UI and data mapping

An instance of a plugin belongs to a single channel and has its own data. More than one instance of the same plugin can be run in the same channel. 
Each instance of a plugin will have:
 An entry in the channel's package manifest file, located in 'channels/%CHANNEL%/plugins/plugin-manifest.json'
 (Optional) One or more data files to store plugin data in the filesystem, in 'channels/%CHANNEL%/plugins/%INSTANCE%/'

Plugins will communicate with the UI through a data mapping. UI elements can contain a data-mapping attribute which will correspond to information in the plugin data sources.
